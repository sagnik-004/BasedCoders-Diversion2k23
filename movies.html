        A film-also called a movie, motion picture, moving picture, picture, photoplay or 
        (slang) flick -is a work of visual art that simulates experiences and otherwise   
        communicates ideas,stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty,or atmosphere through 
        the use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sound and, 
        more rarely, other sensory stimulations.[1] The word "cinema", short for      
        cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry,and
         to the art form that is the result of it.

        The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a 
        motion-picture camera, by photographing drawings or miniature models using  
        traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation, or 
        by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.
        Before the introduction of digital production, series of still images were recorded
        on a strip of chemically sensitized celluloid (photographic film stock), usually at
        the rate of 24 frames per second. The images are transmitted through a movie projector
        at the same rate as they were recorded, with a Geneva drive ensuring that each frame 
        remains still during its short projection time. A rotating shutter causes stroboscopic 
        intervals of darkness, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions due to 
        flicker fusion. The apparent motion on the screen is the result of the fact that the 
        visual sense cannot discern the individual images at high speeds, so the impressions 
        of the images blend with the dark intervals and are thus linked together to produce the 
        illusion of one moving image. An analogous optical soundtrack (a graphic recording of the
         spoken words, music and other sounds) runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved
        for it, and was not projected.Contemporary films are usually fully digital through the entire
        process of production, distribution, and exhibition.

            By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of celluloid photographic film and 
            the invention of motion picture cameras, which could photograph a rapid sequence of images
             using only one lens, allowed action to be captured and stored on a single compact reel of
            film.Movies were initially shown publicly to one person at a time through "peep show" devices 
            such as the Electrotachyscope, Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope. Not much later, exhibitors 
            managed to project films on large screens for theatre audiences.The first public screenings of 
            films at which admission was charged were made in 1895 by the American Woodville Latham and his
             sons, using films produced by their Eidoloscope company,[4] and by the - arguably better known-
             French brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière with ten of their own productions.[citation needed] 
             Private screenings had preceded these by several months, with Latham's slightly predating the 
             Lumière brothers'.[citation needed]

            "Film theory" seeks to develop concise and systematic concepts that apply to the study of film
             as art. The concept of film as an art-form began in 1911 with Ricciotto Canudo's manifest The
              Birth of the Sixth Art. The Moscow Film School, the oldest film school in the world, was founded
             in 1919, in order to teach about and research film theory. Formalist film theory, led by Rudolf 
             Arnheim, Béla Balázs, and Siegfried Kracauer, emphasized how film differed from reality and thus 
             could be considered a valid fine art. André Bazin reacted against this theory by arguing that
             film's artistic essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality, not in its 
             differences from reality, and this gave rise to realist theory. More recent analysis spurred
              by Jacques Lacan's psychoanalysis and Ferdinand de Saussure's semiotics among other things
            has given rise to psychoanalytic film theory, structuralist film theory, feminist film theory,
             and others. On the other hand, critics from the analytical philosophy tradition, influenced 
             by Wittgenstein, try to clarify misconceptions used in theoretical studies and produce analysis
              of a film's vocabulary and its link to a form of life.

            The making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as soon as the 
            process was invented. Upon seeing how successful their new invention, and its product, was
            in their native France, the Lumières quickly set about touring the Continent to exhibit the 
            first films privately to royalty and publicly to the masses. In each country, they would 
            normally add new, local scenes to their catalogue and, quickly enough, found local entrepreneurs
            in the various countries of Europe to buy their equipment and photograph, export, import, and 
            screen additional product commercially. The Oberammergau Passion Play of 1898[7] was the first
             commercial motion picture ever produced. Other pictures soon followed, and motion pictures 
             became a separate industry that overshadowed the vaudeville world. Dedicated theaters and 
             companies formed specifically to produce and distribute films, while motion picture actors
              became major celebrities and commanded huge fees for their performances. By 1917 Charlie 
              Chaplin had a contract that called for an annual salary of one million dollars. From 1931
               to 1956, film was also the only image storage and playback system for television programming
                until the introduction of videotape recorders.
